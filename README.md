#Breast Cancer Detection Model using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning model for breast cancer detection developed using Google Colab. The model employs logistic regression to accurately classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from medical imaging data.

Key Features:
Utilizes Logistic Regression for binary classification of breast tumors
Achieves 98% accuracy in detecting breast cancer
Trained and validated on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
Implements data preprocessing and feature selection techniques
Includes performance evaluation metrics such as Accuracy score
Visualizations of model performance and feature importance
This project demonstrates the application of a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm in medical diagnosis, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in early breast cancer detection.


The Colab notebook in this repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the model, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
